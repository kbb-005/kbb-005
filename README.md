# 👋 Hi, I’m Karan, aka @kbb-005, the Unsocial Animal

- 👀 I’m interested in staying indoors and coding away while avoiding human interaction.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to communicate with other humans... but Java and cloud architecture are more fun.
- 💼 Professionally, I’m a Technical Specialist, but let’s be real, I’m just here to make machines talk to each other so I don’t have to.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that don’t require face-to-face meetings. Preferably ones involving coffee and quiet spaces.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send a carrier pigeon or use [LinkedIn]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/kbb-005](https://www.linkedin.com/in/k-b-70515a177/)), but don't expect instant replies.
- 😄 Pronouns: Introvert/Definitely Introvert
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m so unsocial, my computer is my best friend. Also, I sometimes talk to my coffee mug.
